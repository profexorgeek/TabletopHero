# TabletopHero

TabletopHero is a simple ruleset for playing tabletop roleplaying or tactics games.

I designed the [Core rules](core.md) in 2014 when my kids were too young to play more complicated games. I wanted to balance a formal set of rules for playing games that was simple enough for children but interesting enough to engage adults.

While this ruleset may evolve over time, and include a collection of optional and household rules, its vision is to stay simple enough to quickly teach new people and be easy and cheap to play.

## Materials

To play TabletopHero you need:

- The [Core ruleset](core.md)
- Paper and pencil
- Some six-sided dice (individually referred to as die)
- Some minifigures such as
  - D&D, Pathfinder or other RPG miniatures
  - Plastic army men
  - Lego minis
  - Cardboard cutouts
  - Chess or other placeholders with vertical dimension
- Some random items to use as battlefield obstacles
- Your imagination and a tabletop!
