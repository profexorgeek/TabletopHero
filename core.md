# TabletopHero Core

Tabletop Hero is a simple ruleset for table top role-playing or battle games. To play, you will need this rule set, some household items for battlefield obstacles, minifigures, pencil and paper, 6-sided dice, and your imagination.

These rules are a starting guideline: agree on any special rules, victory conditions, add-on rules or scenarios before the game starts.

**All rules may be overridden by item abilities.**

## Setup

Choose a unit of measurement appropriate to the minieatures you are using. Use centimeters if playing with small minis or inches if playing with larger minis and on a larger battlefield. These rules refer to distance generically in "units".

Create a **battlefield** on a flat surface by placing a variety of items for your troops to climb on and around. Choose some minis to fight with: Lego figures, D&D miniatures, or plastic army men work great. Designate one mini as your hero. Each mini can have 5 points worth of gear from the tables below. Your hero mini can have 10 points worth of gear. Each player should have the same total points for their army. Keep track of your minis items and hitpoints on a piece of paper.

Roll to see who goes first. Move counter-clockwise around the table, starting with the highest-rolling player. Each player chooses a location at an edge of the battlefield to place their army. Each placed mini must be within 5 units from other team members and may not be placed within the firing range of the enemy. If this is impossible, the battlefield is too small. The game starts with the last player to place their army and moves clockwise around the table so that players take their turn in the reverse order that starting positions were chosen. No player may attack on the first turn.

On a players turn, they may choose a mini to move and take actions in any order. Once all eligible minis have moved and used their actions, the next player takes their turn.

## Movement

Each mini can move up to 8 units, minus any speed penalty from their gear. Climbing, decending or rough terrain reduces movement by half. Minis are allowed to move part of their distance, perform and action, and then move the remainder.

## Actions

A mini can perform one **action** against a target each turn if the target is within their item or weapon **Range**. The attacking mini rolls the dice specified in the **Hit** column for their item as its _attacking roll_. The target mini rolls the dice specified in the **Hit** column for their Armor as its _defending roll_. If the _attacking roll_ is **higher** than the _defending roll_, the attack hits. The attacker rolls the dice specified in the **Damage** column as its _damage roll_. Subtract the targetâ€™s armor **Absorb** number from the _damage roll_. The defending mini loses hitpoints equal to the calculated damage.

If a mini does not take an action, it may move twice it's normal range.

## Explosives

Explosives explode whether they hit or miss. On a miss, the attacker must perform a special _direction roll_ to see which direction the explosive bounces. Roll a single die. If the 1 on the die faces directly up or down, the explosive lands as expected but deals half damage. Otherwise, the explosive bounces half its thrown distance from the original target in the direction of the 1 on the die.

Explosives can target hidden units and can be thrown along any arc within their range.  Explosives can be thrown over obstacles that are half their range in height. Explosives are consumed after a single use but a unit may carry multiple explosives.

Explosives deal damage to all minis in a 5 unit radius, regardless of team.

## Critical Hits

An attacker lands a critical hit if they roll the maximum possible on their attack roll. The attack hits, regardless of the defense roll, the weapon deals max damage and ignores armor.

## Cover

- A defender is **Covered** if it is 50% visible from the attacking mini. The defender adds 2 to their defense roll.
- A defender is **Concealed** if it is 30% visible from the attacking mini. The attacker must roll critical to hit.
- A defender is **Hidden** if it is less than 30% visible from the attacking mini and cannot be targeted.

## Health, Damage and Death

Minis start with 6 hitpoints. When a mini has 0 hitpoints, it is unconscious. It gains no **Absorb** benefit from its armor and it cannot move or perform actions if it was unconscious at the begining of the turn. Unconscious minis lose 1 hitpoint at the begining of their turn. If the mini reaches -2 hitpoints it is dead and cannot be healed or revived.

## Winning

The last player with a living hero wins the game. A player loses when their hero is killed.
